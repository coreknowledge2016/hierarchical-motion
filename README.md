# JEPG - Hierarchical Motion Demo 


## Illustration of a single trial
This demo shows the complete steps of a single trial of the position-inference task. Two objects move for 4 seconds, then one of them (the target) becomes invisible. After another 2 seconds, all objects stop moving. An observer is asked to infer the position of the invisible target by mouse click. Inference error is estimated by the distance between the clicked position and the true position.

## Exp_1 Same-node condition
This demo shows a motion trajectory from the Same-node condition in Expt1. The two objects are assigned to the same node, but with different spatial locations.

## Exp_1 Same-branch condition
This demo shows a motion trajectory from the Same-branch condition in Expt1. The parent object is depicted as red, while the child object is depicted as green. Note that in the real experiment, their color is gray.

## Exp_1 Diff-branch condition
This demo shows a motion trajectory from the Diff-branch condition in Expt1. These two objects are assigned to two different branches of a tree.

## Exp_1 Independent condition
This demo shows a motion trajectory from the Independent condition in Expt1. The two objects move independently.
