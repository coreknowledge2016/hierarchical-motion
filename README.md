#Hierarchical Motion Demo

##Demo 1: Assigning objects to a motion tree

This demo illustrates the process of assigning 3 objects to a motion tree. Possible tree branches are showed at first. Each object is assigned to the tree sequentially, following the nest-Chinese Restaurant Process (nCRP) and the Markov random field process.

##Demo 2: Generating tree-structured motions

This demo shows how to generate motions given a tree structure. Firstly, a motion vector is assigned at each node in the tree. At each discrete time step, the motion vectors are drawn from a Gaussian process, which ensures the smoothness of the motion. Secondly, the motion of each object is generated by composing the motion vectors along the path connecting the objects’ node to the root node of the tree. Finally, objects move to new positions by following their composed motions.

##Demo 3: Inferring a tree structure given observed motions

This demo show how a Bayesian model can correctly infer the tree structure by observing a short period of motions. It first depicts a tree structure (the ground truth) and the motions generated by this tree structure. It then shows how a Bayesian inference process draws samples from possible tree structures and correctly infers the true structure, which is mostly sampled.
